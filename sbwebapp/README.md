## Small Bodhi Frontend

This is a simple chatbot experience built with the FASTHTML Python library.

- HomePage with search bar
- form input to get additional context
- Simple DB storage
- call the vector RAG pipeline on top of it
- DockerFile to run all this on maybe a could compute instance or on railway.
- this should be an api service only and fasthtml is just a query engine
